## Acknowledgments
This repository includes introductory demonstrations for Python machine learning techniques. It is built based on the lessons designed by and for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Corporation (LSSTC) Data Science Fellowship Program (DSFP). The [LSSTC DSFP](http://ciera.northwestern.edu/Education/LSSTC_DSFPOverview.php) is a two year training program designed to teach astronomy students essential skills for dealing with big data. A big thanks to them for making this workshop possible!
