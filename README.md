# A Crash Course in Basic Machine Learning in Python

## Requirements
The following programs and packages are required to run these notebooks: 
- `python`
- `scikit-learn` (sklearn)
- `fastai`
- `pytorch`

## Installation

### `scikit-learn`
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
or, if you have `conda`
```
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
```
### `fastai` and `pytorch`
```
pip install -q fastai --upgrade

## Acknowledgments
This repository includes introductory demonstrations for Python machine learning techniques. It is built based on the lessons designed by and for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Corporation (LSSTC) Data Science Fellowship Program (DSFP). The [LSSTC DSFP](http://ciera.northwestern.edu/Education/LSSTC_DSFPOverview.php) is a two year training program designed to teach astronomy students essential skills for dealing with big data. A big thanks to them for making this workshop possible! 

This tutorial also contains techniques I learned through Astro Hack Week, particularly as taught by [John F. Wu](https://jwuphysics.github.io/resources/). Please check out his resources for more information!
